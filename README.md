## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Jupyter notebooks:
1. **Data_Visualization.ipynb**: Contains scripts and plots for visualizing scraped data.
2. **table.ipynb**: Includes data processing steps focused on creating and analyzing tabular data.
3. **webscraping_2021-2023.ipynb**: Main scraping logic, extracting data from web sources from the years 2021-2023.
4. **Scraping Allergen-important.ipynb**: Specific focus on scraping data related to allergens.
5. **webscraping_new.ipynb**: Additional scripts for recent web scraping activities.
6. **web_scrapping.ipynb**: Generalized web scraping scripts that cover multiple sources and formats.
